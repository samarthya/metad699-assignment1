    "\n",
    "The histograms display the processing time (in days) from violation date to hearing date for each of the 5 most common case dispositions in Ward 20. This reveals how quickly the city handles different types of building violation cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key findings that stand out:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Liable Cases are MODERATELY DELAYED (~200-300 days peak):**\n",
    "   - The histogram shows a broad, relatively normal distribution centered around 250-300 days\n",
    "   - The distribution is more spread out than Default cases, suggesting more variability\n",
    "   - *Why:* Even though the defendant is found liable, the process involves evidence review, hearings, and official rulings, which takes substantial time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Suit Cases have HIGH VARIABILITY (200-400+ days, very dispersed):**\n",
    "   - The histogram shows a wide, dispersed distribution with a long right tail extending past 800+ days\n",
    "   - This is the most variable disposition with some cases taking exceptionally long\n",
    "   - *Why:* \"Non-suit\" cases often involve dismissals, procedure issues, or settlements that require back-and-forth negotiation. Some cases get stuck or require multiple filings, explaining the extreme range\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Default Cases are FASTEST & MOST CONCENTRATED (~100-200 days):**\n",
    "   - The histogram shows a sharp, tight peak with the shortest range of delays\n",
    "   - Most cases cluster tightly between 50-250 days\n",
    "   - *Why:* When defendants don't appear, the ruling is automatic and quick—no need for evidence review or trial proceedings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall** Cases requiring judicial review (Liable, Non-Suit, Continuance) take significantly longer than administrative rulings (Default). The more procedurally complex a case, the more variable the processing time.\n"

    "**What the plot shows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart above displays the average imposed fine (penalty amount) for each of the 5 most common case dispositions in Ward 20 (we selected), sorted from highest to lowest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This reveals how the City's penalty structure varies significantly based on the legal outcome of each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default Cases ($4,950 - HIGHEST FINES):**\n",
    "   - Default cases receive dramatically higher average fines than all other dispositions\n",
    "   - The gap between Default ($4,950) and Liable ($958) is more than 5 times.\n",
    "   - *Why:* When defendants fail to appear or respond, the City likely pursues the maximum penalty as enforcement. Default judgments may include automatic penalty assessments or higher starting fines to incentivize compliance and future appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Liable Cases ($958 - MODERATE):**\n",
    "   - Second highest average fine, but still much lower than Default\n",
    "   - *Why:* When the City proves the violation (\"Liable\"), penalties are assessed based on violation severity and evidence presented. These are proportional to the specific building code violation rather than punitive for non-appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuance Cases ($39 - VERY LOW):**\n",
    "   - Cases postponed to future dates have minimal average fines\n",
    "   - *Why:* Continuances are temporary postponements where no ruling has yet been made. Cases likely haven't reached adjudication, so no final penalty has been assessed. The small amount may represent procedural costs or interim penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-Suit Cases ($32 - VERY LOW):**\n",
    "   - When plaintiffs withdraw cases, virtually no fines are imposed\n",
    "   - *Why:* Non-suits represent dismissed cases—no violation was proven. The City has no grounds to impose penalties on dismissed claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not Liable Cases ($3 - LOWEST):**\n",
    "   - Defendants found \"Not Liable\" face almost no financial penalty\n",
    "   - *Why:* When the defendant is cleared of charges, the City cannot impose fines. The minimal amount may be rounding or administrative fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall pattern & explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data reveals a **clear legal principle**: penalties are tied to culpability and case outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Failure to respond/appear (Default)** = Highest penalties (enforcement/deterrent)\n",
    "- **Guilt proven (Liable)** = Moderate penalties (proportional to violation)  \n",
    "- **No fault/dismissal (Not Liable, Non-Suit, Continuance)** = Minimal/no penalties (innocent until proven guilty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure suggests the City uses the fine system not just for revenue, but as a compliance tool—penalizing non-engagement (Defaults) severely while reserving moderate penalties for proven violations.\n"

    "**What the plot shows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram displays the distribution of administrative costs (processing fees) across the five most common case dispositions in Ward 20, with each disposition shown as a transparent overlay. \n",
    "\n",
    "Admin costs represent the operational expenses the City incurs in handling each building violation case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Suit Cases Dominate at $0 (MASSIVE SPIKE):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The tallest peak appears at $0 admin costs, dominated by Non-Suit cases (orange)\n",
    "   - Nearly 10,000 Non-Suit cases have zero associated admin costs\n",
    "   - *Why:* When a case is dismissed (non-suited), minimal administrative processing occurs. The City has already closed the file, so there are no ongoing costs to track or bill\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Liable Cases Show Concentrated Distribution ($50-75 range - NOTABLE CLUSTER):**\n",
    " \n",
    "   - Liable cases (green) form a secondary peak around $50-75\n",
    "   - This represents roughly 8,500 cases with moderate administrative costs\n",
    "   - *Why:* Liable cases require full adjudication—evidence review, hearings, record-keeping, and official determinations. These legal proceedings generate consistent administrative overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Default Cases Spread Across Mid-Range ($50-100+):**\n",
    " \n",
    "   - Default cases (blue) show a broader distribution centered around $50-100\n",
    "   - Approximately 4,500 cases distributed across this range\n",
    "   - *Why:* Defaults still require administrative follow-up for non-response, collection attempts, and case closure documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not Liable & Continuance Cases Show Minimal Spread:**\n",
    " \n",
    "   - Not Liable cases (red) and Continuance cases (purple) are sparsely distributed\n",
    "   - These represent fewer total cases and cluster near lower cost ranges\n",
    "   - *Why:* Not Liable cases are quickly dismissed (minimal paperwork). Continuance cases are merely postponed, so full administrative processing hasn't occurred yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall pattern & explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram reveals a **stark cost-to-outcome relationship**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dismissed cases (Non-Suit)** = Zero admin costs (no resources expended)\n",
    "- **Adjudicated cases (Liable, Default)** = Moderate, consistent costs ($50-100)\n",
    "- **Incomplete/Dismissed cases (Not Liable, Continuance)** = Minimal costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests administrative costs directly reflect case complexity and judicial effort."

Install according to manufacturer instructions. A hard wired model requires an electrical wiring permit. In a single family residence, be sure the detector is on or below the lowest floor with a place to sleep. In a multiple dwelling residence heated by a boiler, install a detector in the same room as the boiler. Otherwise, each apartment follows single family guidelines. The owner is responsible for installation and written instructions, the tenant for testing, maintenance, and batteries.     442\n",

    "**What this plot shows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart displays the average penalty amount imposed for each of the 5 most common building violation types in Ward 20, sorted from highest to lowest fines. This reveals which violation categories the City penalizes most heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key findings (sorted by severity of penalties):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Window Panes ($1,539 - HIGHEST FINE):**\n",
    "   - Nearly double the fine for Inspection Access violations\n",
    "   - *Why:* Windows are critical for building safety, security, and weatherproofing. Broken/missing window panes expose interiors to weather damage, pest infiltration, and security risks. The high fine incentivizes rapid replacement to prevent escalating property damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exterior Wall ($1,205 - SECOND HIGHEST):**\n",
    "   - Structural integrity is paramount—exterior walls protect the entire building\n",
    "   - *Why:* Wall deterioration compromises structural stability and exposes the building to water damage, mold, and potential collapse. The city prioritizes these repairs through substantial fines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Porch System ($1,107 - MODERATE-HIGH):**\n",
    "   - Porches are structural extensions that can fail and injure occupants if neglected\n",
    "   - *Why:* Failed porch systems pose immediate safety hazards (collapse risk). The moderate-high fine reflects the danger but is lower than walls because they're secondary structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Owner Info ($1,041 - MODERATE):**\n",
    "   - Administrative requirement to post owner contact information\n",
    "   - *Why:* This is primarily a compliance/administrative issue—it doesn't directly threaten building safety but allows tenants/city to contact responsible parties. Fines are moderate to encourage compliance without excessive punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inspection Access ($854 - LOWEST FINE):**\n",
    "   - Administrative requirement to allow city inspectors access\n",
    "   - *Why:* This is the least \"structural\"—it's about process and cooperation. The lower fine reflects that violation of inspection access is more about obstructing oversight than causing direct physical harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall pattern & explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fines follow a clear **safety hierarchy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Violation Type | Fine | Category |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1 | Window Panes | $1,539 | **Critical Safety** (weatherproofing, security) |\n",
    "| 2 | Exterior Wall | $1,205 | **Structural Integrity** (building stability) |\n",
    "| 3 | Porch System | $1,107 | **Secondary Structure** (occupant safety) |\n",
    "| 4 | Owner Info | $1,041 | **Administrative** (compliance, accountability) |\n",
    "| 5 | Inspection Access | $854 | **Procedural** (oversight/cooperation) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The City's fine structure is **risk-based**: violations threatening immediate physical safety and structural integrity receive substantially higher penalties ($1,200-$1,500 range) than administrative compliance issues ($850-$1,000 range). \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy incentivizes building owners to focus on life-safety issues first, then handle administrative requirements second.\n"
